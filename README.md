A simple one header/one source solution to parsing JSON in C and C++.

JSON is parsed into a read-only, single allocation buffer.

## Usage ##

Just include json.h, json.c in your code!

The current supported compilers are gcc, clang and msvc.

The current tested compiler versions are gcc 4.8.2, clang 3.5 and MSVC 18.0.21005.1.

## Design ##

The json_parse function calls malloc once, and then slices up this single
allocation to support all the weird and wonderful JSON structures you can
imagine!

The structure of the data is always the json structs first (which encode the
structure of the original JSON), followed by the data.

## Todo ##

- Add debug output to specify why either the parser or printer failed (as suggested by [@hugin84](https://twitter.com/hugin84) in https://twitter.com/hugin84/status/668506811595677696)
- Add [Simplified JSON](http://bitsquid.blogspot.fr/2009/10/simplified-json-notation.html) support (as suggested by [@dougbinks](https://twitter.com/dougbinks) in https://twitter.com/dougbinks/status/633567020177575936)
- Compare performance with [sajson](http://t.co/tIRNZUQimR) (as suggested by [@antumbral](https://twitter.com/antumbral) in https://twitter.com/antumbral/status/633567121134370816)
